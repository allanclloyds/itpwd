I remember him as if it were yesterday, as he came plodding to the inn door,
his sea-chest following behind him in a hand-barrowâ€”a tall, strong, heavy,
nut-brown man, his tarry pigtail falling over the shoulder of his soiled blue
coat, his hands ragged and scarred, with black, broken nails, and the sabre cut
across one cheek, a dirty, livid white. I remember him looking round the cover
and whistling to himself as he did so, and then breaking out in that old
sea-song that he sang so often afterwards:

          "Fifteen men on the dead man's chest -
             Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!"

in the high, old tottering voice that seemed to have been tuned and broken at
the capstan bars. Then he rapped on the door with a bit of stick like a
handspike that he carried, and when my father appeared, called roughly for a
glass of rum. This, when it was brought to him, he drank slowly, like a
connoisseur, lingering on the taste and still looking about him at the cliffs
and up at our signboard.

  -- Robert Louis Stevenson
